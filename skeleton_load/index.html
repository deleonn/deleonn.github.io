      <h1 class="title">What is Skeleton Load?</h1>
    </div>
    <p>Skeleton load is the name I used to call a modern way to indicate loading processes in any website, althought the web community just called it skeleton screen. It is a modern and pleasing-to-the-eye alternative for the old and boring loading spinners.</p>
    <div class="space"></div>

    <p>According to the definitions given through many blogs and websites, the skeleton load or <i>skeleton screen</i> it's a version of a page to be rendered by the browser for the users to see it, in which the main content or information is going to be loaded.</p>
    <div class="space"></div>

    <p>The user <a href="https://github.com/basham">@basham</a> commented on an issue opened in GitHub stating that <q>with a skeleton screen, the focus is on content being loaded not the fact that its loading and thatâ€™s real progress.</q> You can watch the entire post <a href="https://github.com/ksux/ks-design-guide/issues/38">here</a>.</p>
    <div class="space"></div>

    <p style="font-size:16px;">Quick fact: at the time, you might already now this but Facebook, Nintendo, Apple and many others are using skeleton screens.</p>
    <div class="space"></div>

    <h1 class="title">Why is it important?</h1>
    <p>The skeleton load it's a way to convert the <i>loading experience</i> we already know into information, allowing the user to be prepared to the content that is going to be rendered. It's like saying: <q>Hey there, it doesn't matter if this is your first time here, we are going to display information in this skeleton so you can easily distinguish where to look at</q>.</p>
    <div class="space"></div>

    <h1 class="title">Live Example</h1>
    <p>Watch a <a href="skeleton.html">live example</a> I made myself, using pure css and AngularJS to simulate an ajax call with the $timeout function. The skeleton is the first thing rendered, and after 2 seconds, it is removed from the DOM and the simulated fully loaded ajax response is displayed.</p>
    <div class="space"></div>

    <h1 class="title">Conclusion</h1>
    <p>User Experience is something we, as developers, need to take care of and give the importance it deserves. I've experienced myself many divided arguments between web developers about how important backend all alone is, or that frontend developers or web  designers shouldn't be treated as respectable developers. Whatever your opinion is, skeleton load is an example of how web design -and I'm not talking about pure design- actually matters to every dev out there, to make our projects or applications more enjoyable to the users, as that may be the most important thing of web development. Things like this should be included at the Web Developing 101: Best Practices books all over the place. It would give the <q>new guys</q> the ability to create very nice and simple user interfaces without having too much knowledge in their firsts projects. If loading spinners are such easy things, why not the skeleton screens?</p>
